Introduction

Welcome to the Image Processing project! In this project, our task was to implement spatial domain and frequency domain filters from scratch using Python. We also created a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience. The spatial domain filters include the average filter, Sobel filter, and Robert Cross filter, among others. In the frequency domain, we implemented filters such as histogram equalization. Each filter has a specific function in adjusting the image, including blurring, sharpening, object detection, contour extraction, and noise pattern identification. Our GUI allows users to select an image from their device and apply various filters to process and enhance the image. Let's explore the key features and details of our Image Processing project.
Features

    Spatial Domain Filters: We have implemented various spatial domain filters, including:
        Average filter: Smooths the image by calculating the average of the pixel values in a neighborhood.
        Sobel filter: Detects edges in the image by calculating the gradient magnitude.
        Robert Cross filter: Detects edges using the Robert Cross operator.
        And more: We have implemented other spatial domain filters with different functionalities for blurring, sharpening, object detection, and contour extraction.

    Frequency Domain Filters: We have implemented frequency domain filters, including:
        Histogram equalization: Enhances the contrast of an image by redistributing the pixel intensity values.
        Additional filters: We have implemented other frequency domain filters for various image enhancement purposes.

    Graphical User Interface (GUI): We have developed a user-friendly GUI that allows users to:
        Select an image from their device.
        Apply various spatial and frequency domain filters to the selected image.
        Visualize the results of the applied filters.
        Save the processed image.
